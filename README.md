# Matrix2Img

This Python program reads a matrix of values ranging from 0 to 255 to create an image or edit an existing image by altering its matrix. Unleash your creativity to transform images with effects like mesh or draw circles, and more! The only limit is your imagination.

## Dependencies

The program uses the following modules:

- [PIL (Python Imaging Library)](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): For image processing and manipulation.
- [Math](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html): For mathematical calculations like drawing circles.

## Usage

To create or edit an image using the Matrix Image Editor, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your matrix file containing values ranging from 0 to 255 with each line representing a row of pixels. (Check a.txt)
2. Run the `Matrix2Img.py` script:

```bash
